Based on the visualization of the data, it is evident that both performance and job role directly impact the level of salary. The role is determined by the required skills, and the more skills are required, the higher the salary tends to be. Additionally, if your performance is outstanding, it also positively influences your salary.


### Salary - Working Year - Performance

According to the data visualization, both performance and working years will affect the level of salary. It will not significantly increase your salary based on your performance or working years alone.


### Salary - Working Year - Role

However, according to the data visualization, there is no clear relationship between working years and role that would directly lead to a significant salary increase.
